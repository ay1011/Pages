# Trends


1. **The risk of Dollar destruction & the Rise of Alternative Currencies**[^1]: With 35% of all Dollars (US $) ever created being printed between February and December 2020, there is the potential for an unprecedented dip in the currency’s purchasing power and inflation.

2. **Age of Exponentials & Rise of Robots**[^1]: DNA sequencing, blockchain, energy storage, robotics, and AI are seeing exponential growth and as a result interest from investors is high. These future thinking technologies will not only realign the world and the processes we use, but it will also touch every sector, from health to education, global warming, and innovation. 

3. **The collapse of traditional banks?**[^1]: Traditional banks are facing potentially sizable risks from digital wallets and digital lenders who are likely to take a share of business. Two of the biggest digital wallets, Square’s Cash App and PayPal’s Venmo, each amassed over 60 million active users organically in the last 7 and 10 years, respectively.  At the end of 2020, the number of J.P. Morgan Chase deposit account holders totalled approximately 60 million while Cash App’s and Venmo’s Annual Active Users scaled to 59 million and 69 million, respectively. This illustrates a growing trend away from the traditional banking relationship, and toward a very decentralised financial system. 

4. **Education Sector Growth**[^1] – Edtech companies with their own curriculum are growing quickly, particularly through acquisition, and creating an education system that delivers personalised, relevant, and lifelong learning pathways to everyone.
